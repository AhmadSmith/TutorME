		<h1>Science</h1>
		
		<p>It is safe to say that science is one of the most interesting subjects and yet the most diffucult to learn and understand, but once you get it; its easier than you think. The thing about science is that you have to pay atention in class, if you don't yoo'll feel like they left you in another unit. So some good advise is to get lots of sleep before this class ,and/or get rid of any distractions in this class it is imparitive if you wish to learn anything effectively in this class. </p>
